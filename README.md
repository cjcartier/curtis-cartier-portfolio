# Curtis Cartier's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and the technologies I use.
It serves as a living document of my journey as a developer and provides insights into my development process.

## Project Structure

This portfolio is organized into multiple workspaces, which allows for efficient management of dependencies and scripts
across different parts of the project. The main directories include:

- **apps/**: Contains the main applications, such as the web front-end and content management system (CMS).
- **packages/**: Houses shared packages and libraries used across applications.

## Technologies Used

### TypeScript

I use TypeScript as the primary language for building both client-side and server-side applications. TypeScript's static
typing and advanced features enhance code quality, making it easier to catch errors early and improve maintainability.
Its integration with modern JavaScript frameworks ensures a robust development experience.

### Next.js

Next.js is utilized as the React framework for building the web front-end of this portfolio. It provides powerful
features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, which enhance performance and SEO.
Next.js's seamless integration with React and its developer-friendly environment make it an ideal choice for building
modern web applications.

### Turbo

Turbo is a powerful build system used in this portfolio to orchestrate tasks and manage complex workflows efficiently.
It allows for running scripts in parallel, which significantly speeds up the development process. Turbo's caching
mechanism ensures that only the necessary tasks are re-executed, saving time and computational resources.

With Turbo, I can streamline the build process, handle dependencies effectively, and maintain a robust development
environment. Its ability to manage multiple tasks concurrently makes it an indispensable tool for building scalable
applications. Turbo's integration with modern development practices ensures that the project remains fast, efficient,
and easy to maintain.

### Sanity

Sanity is used as the content management system (CMS) for this portfolio. It provides a powerful and flexible way to
manage and deliver content. Sanity's real-time collaboration features and customizable content models make it easy to
tailor the CMS to specific project needs.

The integration of Sanity with this portfolio allows for seamless content updates and efficient content management. Its
API-first approach ensures that the content is accessible and can be easily integrated into different parts of the
application, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Styling with Panda CSS

I use Panda CSS as the style system for this portfolio. Panda CSS offers a flexible and efficient way to manage styles
across applications. It allows for modular and reusable style definitions, making it easier to maintain a consistent
look and feel throughout the project.

Panda CSS supports modern CSS features and integrates seamlessly with the existing JavaScript and Node.js setup. This
ensures that the styling is both powerful and easy to work with, aligning with the overall goal of building scalable and
maintainable applications.

By using Panda CSS, I can focus on creating beautiful and responsive designs without getting bogged down by complex
style sheets. This enhances the overall user experience and ensures that the applications look great on all devices.

### Prettier and Linting Tools

To maintain a consistent code style, I use Prettier for formatting and linting capabilities. This ensures that the
codebase remains clean and easy to read.

### Husky and Lint-Staged

Husky and lint-staged are employed to enforce code quality by running linting and formatting checks before commits. This
helps catch potential issues early in the development process.

### Vitest

Vitest is employed for testing within the Utils package of this portfolio. It provides a fast and efficient testing
environment that integrates well with modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects. By using Vitest, I ensure that the
utility functions are reliable and perform as expected, contributing to the overall robustness of the codebase.

### Environment Management

I use `dotenv-cli` to manage environment variables, ensuring that the applications run smoothly across different
environments.

## Node.js Version

The project requires Node.js version 20 or higher, as specified in the package.json file. This ensures compatibility
with the latest features and security updates.

## How to Run

To get started with this portfolio, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

This will set up the development environment and start the applications.

## Conclusion

This portfolio is a reflection of my skills and my approach to software development. I continuously update it with new
projects and improvements. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any
questions!
